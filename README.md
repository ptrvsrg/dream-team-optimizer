  <summary>More detailed description of the task</summary>

**The Dream Team Optimizer** project is designed to optimally form development teams based on their preferences gathered
during the hackathon. Each developer (June or team leader) makes a list of desirable colleagues with whom he would like
to work in a team. Based on this data, the project calculates the satisfaction index for each participant, and then
calculates the harmony of the team distribution. The main goal of the project is to maximize the harmony of team
formation in order to ensure the greatest satisfaction of the participants. This tool can be useful for HR professionals
to optimize the process of creating dream teams.
